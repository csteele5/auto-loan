# auto-loan

Simple React UI for simulating an auto loan pre-approval

## Overview

The purpose of this site to demonstrate user form input, form validation, and mock calls to a back end data service.

## Process Flow

The user will fill out basic information about the auto they would like to purchase as well as their income and credit score. After the form is validated, the loan will be prequalified through a backend service call. Upon successful qualification, the user will be prompted to register with the site to continue the loan process. Rejected loan qualifications will be sent to a dead end page and provided a message.

## Running the Site

To run the web site locally, follow these steps:

- Download the source code from the GitHub repository to your local drive
- Extract or Unzip the code (if compressed) into any working directory
- Navigate to the auto-loan directory (containing the src and public directories)
- Open a terminal window or command prompt at this directory and run the following:

```
yarn start
```

If all goes well, your default browser window should open up to http://localhost:3000
If the browser does not open automatically and the above link will not connect to the site, verify that port 3000 is not already in use on your computer.

**Good luck, and don't let Billy Bob loan you money!**
